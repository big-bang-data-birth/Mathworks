# Hands-On AI for Smart Appliances: From Sensor Data to Embedded Code
Curious how AI powers smart appliances? Join our hands-on workshop to turn sensor data into deployable embedded code for IoT, automotive, robotics, and more. Build efficient AI at #MATLABEXPO!

In this hands-on workshop, engineers and developers will master a streamlined workflow for deploying artificial intelligence on resource-constrained embedded systems. Using a relatable smart home appliance application (e.g., washing machine load imbalance detection) as a practical case study, see how the presented principles and methodologies are directly applicable to a wide array of sensor-driven systems, including industrial IoT, automotive applications, robotics, wearable technology, and other fields where efficient, on-device AI is critical.

Actively navigate the complete end-to-end AI deployment pipeline. Through guided exercises, learn to transform raw sensor signals into actionable intelligence, select and train deployment-aware AI models, optimize these models for minimal memory footprint and computational load, and automatically generate hardware-aware C/C++ code ready for integration.

This session emphasizes a hardware-aware approach, enabling engineers to rapidly develop, validate, and deploy robust AI solutions. Leave with the practical skills to effectively take AI solutions from initial sensor data through to deployable embedded code for smart appliances and similar applications using MATLAB® and Simulink® products.
